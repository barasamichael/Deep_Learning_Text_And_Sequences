# Deep Learning for Texts and Sequences Practice

This repository serves as a personal workspace for my deep learning experiments and 
practice with text and sequential data. Here, I explore various deep learning techniques, 
models, and datasets to enhance my skills and understanding in this field.


## Projects


Feel free to explore each project folder for detailed code, datasets, and any notes 
I've added along the way. These projects help me refine my skills and deepen my 
understanding of deep learning for text and sequences.

## Usage
To run any of the projects, navigate to the respective project folder and follow 
the instructions provided in the project's README file.

## License
This repository is for my personal practice and experimentation purposes. Redistribution 
and external use should align with policies set by *Fracois Chollet* in his book 
*Deep Learning with Python*.

Happy coding and learning!
